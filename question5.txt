Question 5: Explain Z-index, with a code example

Solution:

    The z-index CSS property specifies the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants or flex items. 
Overlapping elements with a higher z-index cover those with a lower one. It only affects elements that have a 
position value other than static (i.e., position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky).
The z-index can take the following values

An integer value (positive or negative), specifying the order in which the element is layered on the page.
 Higher values are closer to the front

'auto', which sets the z-order to be the same as its parent. This is the default value.
